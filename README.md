## Installation Requirements

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip3 install mcp-server requests pydantic

# When you’re done, you can deactivate the virtual environment
# deactivate
```

### Direct Installation

If you prefer not to use a virtual environment, you can install the dependencies directly:

```bash
pip3 install mcp-server requests pydantic
```

## Usage

### 1. Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key with One Call API 3.0 Access

1. Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and register an account
2. Subscribe to the "One Call API 3.0" plan (offers 1,000 API calls per day for free)
3. Wait for API key activation (this can take up to an hour)

#### About the One Call API 3.0

The One Call API 3.0 provides comprehensive weather data:
- Current weather conditions
- Minute forecast for 1 hour
- Hourly forecast for 48 hours
- Daily forecast for 8 days (including today)
- National weather alerts
- Historical weather data

#### API Usage and Limits

- **Free tier**: 1,000 API calls per day
- **Default limit**: 2,000 API calls per day (can be adjusted in your account)
- **Billing**: Any calls beyond the free 1,000/day will be charged according to OpenWeatherMap pricing
- **Usage cap**: You can set a call limit in your account to prevent exceeding your budget
- If you reach your limit, you'll receive a "429" error response

> **Note**: API key activation can take several minutes up to an hour. If you receive authentication errors shortly after subscribing, please wait and try again later.

### 2. Run the Server

There are two ways to provide the API key:

#### Method 1: Using Environment Variables

```bash
# Set environment variables
export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_api_key"  # Linux/Mac
set OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key  # Windows

# Run the server
python weather_mcp_server.py
```

#### Method 2: Provide When Calling the Tool

Run directly without setting environment variables:

```bash
python weather_mcp_server.py
```

When calling the tool, you'll need to provide the `api_key` parameter.

### 3. Use in MCP Client Configuration

Add the following configuration to your MCP-supported client:

```json
{
  "weather_forecast": {
    "command": "python3",
    "args": [
      "/full_path/weather_mcp_server.py"
    ],
    "env": {
      "OPENWEATHER_API_KEY": "your_openweathermap_key_here"
    },
    "disabled": false,
    "autoApprove": ["get_weather", "get_current_weather"]
  }
}
```

If you're using a virtual environment, your configuration should include the path to the Python executable in the virtual environment:

```json
{
  "weather_forecast": {
    "command": "/full_path/venv/bin/python3",
    "args": [
      "/full_path/weather_mcp_server.py"
    ],
    "env": {
      "OPENWEATHER_API_KEY": "your_openweathermap_key_here"
    },
    "disabled": false,
    "autoApprove": ["get_weather", "get_current_weather"]
  }
}
```

### 4. Available Tools

#### get_weather

Get comprehensive weather data for a location including current weather and 8-day forecast with detailed information.

Parameters:
- `location`: Location name, e.g., "Beijing", "New York", "Tokyo"
- `api_key`: OpenWeatherMap API key (optional, will read from environment variable if not provided)
- `timezone_offset`: Timezone offset in hours, e.g., 8 for Beijing, -4 for New York. Default is 0 (UTC time)

Returns:
- Current weather information
- Hourly forecasts for the next 48 hours
- Daily forecasts for 8 days (today + 7 days ahead)
- Morning (9 AM), afternoon (3 PM), and evening (8 PM) data points for each day
- Weather summaries and precipitation probabilities
- Detailed weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

Perfect for use cases like:
- "Which day this week should I mow my lawn?"
- "When is the best time to go for a run?"
- "Will it rain this weekend?"

##### Location Lookup Details

The `location` parameter uses OpenWeatherMap's geocoding to convert location names to geographic coordinates:

- Simple location names work: "Paris", "Tokyo", "New York"
- For better accuracy, include country codes: "Paris,FR", "London,GB", "Portland,US"
- For US cities, you can include state: "Portland,OR,US" or "Portland,ME,US"
- The API supports any location on Earth that OpenWeatherMap can geocode
- Location names are converted to latitude/longitude coordinates internally

If a location can't be found, the API will return an error. In case of ambiguous locations, try adding country or state codes for more precise results.

#### get_current_weather

Get current weather for a specified location.

Parameters:
- `location`: Location name, e.g., "Beijing", "New York", "Tokyo"
- `api_key`: OpenWeatherMap API key (optional, will read from environment variable if not provided)
- `timezone_offset`: Timezone offset in hours, e.g., 8 for Beijing, -4 for New York. Default is 0 (UTC time)

##### Location Lookup Details

The same location lookup process applies as described in the `get_weather` tool above. For ambiguous city names, include country codes for precise results.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Current Weather

```
User: What's the weather like in New York right now?

AI: Let me check the current weather in New York for you.
[Calling get_current_weather("New York", timezone_offset=-4)]

Current weather in New York: 5°C, few clouds, humidity 42%, wind speed 4.1m/s.
```

### Example 2: Weekly Planning

```
User: I need to mow my lawn this week in Boston. Which day would be best?

AI: Let me check the weather forecast for Boston to find the best day for lawn mowing.
[Calling get_weather("Boston", timezone_offset=-4)]

Looking at the Boston forecast for the week:
- Today (Monday): Light rain (28% chance), 5°C
- Tuesday: Clear, sunny, 10°C
- Wednesday: Light rain (100% chance), 9°C
- Thursday: Moderate rain (100% chance), 10°C
- Friday: Moderate rain (100% chance), 11°C
- Saturday: Partly cloudy, 13°C
- Sunday: Scattered clouds, 17°C

Tuesday would be your best option for mowing the lawn. It will be clear and sunny with no chance of rain, and the temperature will be comfortable at around 10°C.
```

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

If you encounter an "Invalid API key" or authorization error:
1. Make sure you've subscribed to the "One Call API 3.0" plan
2. Remember that API key activation can take up to an hour
3. Verify you have set the OPENWEATHER_API_KEY correctly in environment variables
4. Check that you're providing the correct api_key parameter when calling the tools

### Other Common Issues

- **"Location not found" error**:
  - Try using a more accurate city name or add a country code, e.g., "Beijing,CN" or "Paris,FR"
  - For US cities with common names, specify the state: "Springfield,IL,US" or "Portland,OR,US"
  - Check for typos in location names
  - Some very small or remote locations might not be in OpenWeatherMap's database

- **Incorrect location returned**:
  - For cities with the same name in different countries, always include the country code
  - Example: "Paris,FR" for Paris, France vs "Paris,TX,US" for Paris, Texas

- **Rate limiting (429 error)**: You've exceeded your API call limit. Check your OpenWeatherMap account settings.

## Development and Testing

### Testing

This project includes test files to validate the MCP server functionality. The server has been manually tested to ensure it works correctly with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients.

#### Manual Testing

The simplest way to test the server is to:

1. Set your OpenWeatherMap API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python3 weather_mcp_server.py
   ```

3. In another terminal, you can send a test request using curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"tool": "get_current_weather", "parameters": {"location": "New York", "timezone_offset": -4}}' http://localhost:8000
   ```

#### Automated Tests

The repository includes unit and integration test files that:
- Test API key handling and validation
- Validate data parsing and formatting
- Verify error handling for API failures
- Test both MCP tools: `get_weather` and `get_current_weather`

These tests require proper setup of the development environment with all dependencies installed. They're provided as reference for future development.
